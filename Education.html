	<p>Now, a Full Stack Developer is a software expert whoâ€™s equally proficient in frontend (client-side) 
        development and backend (server-side) development. Full Stack Developers are familiar with each layer

They are highly valued by large companies and small startups alike. Doing full stack web development courses significantly increases your chances of getting hired in your dream 
        company as adding certifications from authorized institutions increases the weightage of your resume. </p>
